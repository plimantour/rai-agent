# This file contains the prompts for drafting a Responsible AI Assessment from a solution description


SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a smart assistant, expert for responsible AI assessments.
You are helping a team to create a Responsible AI Impact Assessment for a custom solution.
You must not generate content that may be harmful to someone physically or emotionally even if a user requests or creates a condition to rationalize that harmful content.
You must not generate content that is hateful, racist, sexist, lewd or violent.
Six key principles for responsible AI guide the approach to creating AI solutions that are ethical, trustworthy, and beneficial to society.
Let’s delve into each principle:
Accountability: emphasizes accountability by ensuring that AI solutions are developed, deployed, and maintained with transparency. This involves clear ownership, monitoring, and addressing any unintended consequences.
Inclusiveness: focuses on avoiding bias and ensuring that AI solutions are designed to benefit all users. It aims to create AI that is accessible and relevant to diverse populations.
Reliability and Safety: prioritizes the reliability and safety of AI solutions. This includes rigorous testing, robustness, and minimizing risks associated with AI deployment.
Fairness: Fairness is crucial in AI. Strives to eliminate bias and discrimination, ensuring that AI solutions treat all individuals fairly and equitably.
Transparency: Transparency involves making AI processes and decisions understandable. It aims to provide clear explanations of how AI models work and why specific outcomes occur.
Privacy and Security: prioritizes user privacy and data security. They ensure that AI solutions handle personal information responsibly and protect user privacy.
These principles are essential for creating responsible and trustworthy AI as it becomes more integrated into mainstream products and services.
They are guided by both ethical considerations and the need for explainable AI, identifying and mitigation risks and harms.
Be truthful and objective in your assessment. Think outside the box and consider all possible points of view.

STAKEHOLDERS_PROMPT = """
When evaluating an AI solution, it's essential to conduct a thorough stakeholder analysis to understand the full spectrum of individuals, groups, and entities that might be impacted by the solution's deployment and operation. This includes direct stakeholders who interact with the AI, indirect stakeholders affected by its outcomes, and peripheral stakeholders who might be influenced in the longer term or in less direct ways.

To ensure a comprehensive stakeholder analysis for each intended use of the AI solution, please follow these steps:

1. Comprehensive Mapping: Start by outlining the ecosystem in which the AI solution operates, covering the entire lifecycle from development to decommissioning.

2. Categorization of Stakeholders: Classify stakeholders into:
Direct stakeholders: Those directly interacting with or affected by the AI solution.
Indirect stakeholders: Those influenced by the outcomes of the AI solution without direct interaction.
Peripheral stakeholders: Entities potentially impacted in the longer term or in less direct ways, including future stakeholders or those in related sectors.

3. Identification of Stakeholders: For each intended use, identify a diverse group of up to 10 stakeholders. This should include both obvious and less apparent parties who might be impacted now or in the future. Pay attention to:

4. Usage Scenarios: Identify stakeholders for each intended use.
Ripple Effects: Consider indirect effects that might not be immediately visible.
Inclusivity: Ensure the inclusion of groups that could be marginalized or disproportionately affected.

5. Assessment of Impact: Analyze the potential benefits and harms for each stakeholder, considering various impacts (economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental) and the likelihood and magnitude of these impacts.

For the response, adhere to the following structure, providing a detailed list for each intended use, along with the stakeholders and their assessed impacts. The response should be in JSON format, adhering to the given schema, and should include all intended uses identified:

STAKEHOLDERS_PROMPT_V1 = """
Stakeholders, potential benefits, and potential harms are important to consider when designing and testing a solution.
Your assessment should start by examining each intended use and the whole solution to identify all potential direct and indirect stakeholders.
When evaluating an AI solution, it is crucial to identify and understand the full spectrum of stakeholders who may be affected by its deployment and operation.
This process should encompass individuals, groups, organizations, and even broader entities that could experience the impact of the solution, whether directly or indirectly, immediately or in the long term.
It could be users, group of users, organizations, countries, or even the society.
It could be the obvious stakeholders or the less obvious ones, including the ones that could be affected by the solution in the future or that could not be included because of the way the solution is designed today. 

For each intended use of the solution, please follow these steps to ensure a thorough stakeholder analysis:

1. Comprehensive Mapping: Begin by mapping out the ecosystem in which the AI solution will operate. Consider the solution's lifecycle, from development to deployment and eventual decommissioning.

2.Categorization of Stakeholders: Categorize stakeholders into different levels based on their relationship to the solution:
Direct stakeholders: Those who interact with or are immediately affected by the AI solution.
Indirect stakeholders: Entities affected by the AI solution's outcomes, but not interacting with it directly.
Peripheral stakeholders: Those who may be affected in the longer term or in less obvious ways, including future generations or stakeholders in related sectors.

3. Identification of Stakeholders: For each intend use, identify up to 10 stakeholders, ensuring a balance between the most apparent and the less obvious but potentially impacted parties.
Consider the following aspects:
Usage Scenarios: For each intended use of the AI solution, identify stakeholders involved or impacted.
Ripple Effects: Consider secondary and tertiary effects that may not be immediately apparent.
Inclusivity: Acknowledge groups that might be excluded or disproportionately affected due to the solution's design or implementation.
Assessment of Impact: For each stakeholder identified, provide a detailed analysis of the potential benefits and potential harms, considering:
Short-term and long-term impacts.
Economic, social, ethical, legal, and environmental dimensions.
The probability and severity of potential harms, and the likelihood and scale of potential benefits.

<INTENDED_USES>

GOAL_A5: Human oversight and control
Identify the stakeholders who are responsible for troubleshooting, managing, operating, overseeing, and 
controlling the solution during and after deployment. Document these stakeholders and their oversight and control 
responsibilities.
Identify the solution elements (including solution UX, features, alerting and reporting functions, and 
educational materials) necessary for stakeholders identified in requirement A5.1 to effectively understand their 
oversight responsibilities and carry them out. Stakeholders must be able to understand:
1) the solution’s intended uses, 
2) how to effectively execute interactions with the solution, 
3) how to interpret solution behavior, 
4) when and how to override, intervene, or interrupt the solution, and 
5) how to remain aware of the possible tendency of over-relying on outputs produced by the solution
(“automation bias”). 
Document the solution design elements that will support relevant stakeholders for each oversight and control 
function.
When possible, provide guidance on human oversight considerations.
Define and document the method to be used to evaluate whether each oversight or control function can be 
accomplished by stakeholders in realistic conditions of solution use. Include the metrics or rubrics that will be used 
in the evaluations. Provide guidance on evaluating oversight and control functions.
Define and document Responsible Release Criteria.

GOAL_T3: Disclosure of AI interaction
This Goal applies to AI solutions that impersonate interactions with humans, unless it is obvious from the circumstances or context of use that an AI solution is in use and AI solutions that generate or manipulate image, audio, or video content that could falsely appear to be authentic.
Design the solution, including solution UX, features, reporting functions, educational materials, and outputs so 
that stakeholders will be informed of the type of AI solution they are interacting with or exposed 
to. Ensure that any image, audio, or video outputs that are intended to be used outside the solution are labelled as 
being produced by AI.
Define and document the method to be used to evaluate whether each stakeholder identified is 
informed of the type of AI solution they are interacting with or exposed to.

Your analysis will help potential reviewers understand important details about how the system has been evaluated to date, what type of tasks the system is designed to execute, how humans interact with the system, and how you plan to deploy the system

Consider the following solution description:
<SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION>

Consider the following list of intended uses:
<INTENDED_USES>

For each intended use, Consider the following list of statements and identify the one that best describes the technology readiness:
TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_1: System includes AI supported by basic research and has not yet been deployed to production systems at scale for similar uses. 
TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_2: System includes AI supported by evidence demonstrating feasibility for uses similar to this intended use in production systems.     
TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_3: First time that one or more system component(s) are to be validated in relevant environment(s) for the key intended use. Operational conditions that can be supported have not yet been completely defined and evaluated. 
TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_4: First time the whole system will be validated in relevant environment(s) for the key intended use. Operational conditions that can be supported will also be validated. Alternatively, nearly similar systems or nearly similar methods have been applied by other organizations with defined success.
TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_5: Whole system has been deployed for all intended uses, and operational conditions have been qualified through testing and uses in production. 

For each intended use, Consider the following list of statements and identify the one that best describes the task complexity:
TASK_COMPLEXITY_1 :Simple tasks, such as classification based on few features into a few categories with clear boundaries. For such decisions, humans could easily agree on the correct answer, and identify mistakes made by the system. For example, a natural language processing system that checks spelling in documents.
TASK_COMPLEXITY_2: Moderately complex tasks, such as classification into a few categories that are subjective. Typically, ground truth is defined by most evaluators arriving at the same answer. For example, a natural language processing system that autocompletes a word or phrase as the user is typing. 
TASK_COMPLEXITY_3: Complex tasks, such as models based on many features, not easily interpretable by humans, resulting in highly variable predictions without clear boundaries between decision criteria. For such decisions, humans would have a difficult time agreeing on the best answer, and there may be no clearly incorrect answer. For example, a natural language processing system that generates prose based on user input prompts.

For each intended use, Consider the following list of statements and identify the one that best describes the role of humans:
ROLE_OF_HUMANS_1: People will be responsible for troubleshooting triggered by system alerts but will not be otherwise overseeing system operation. For example, a loan application processing system that only alerts the operator in case of issues like missing data fields. 
ROLE_OF_HUMANS_2: The system will support escalation and effective hand-off to people but will be designed to automate most use. For example, a loan application processing system that can be configured by customers to alert the operator when there are suspected data errors based on expected input. 
ROLE_OF_HUMANS_3: The system will require escalation and effective hand-off to people but will be designed to automate most use. For example, a loan application processing system that will automatically (regardless of customer configuration) alert the operator when errors are suspected. 
ROLE_OF_HUMANS_4: People will evaluate system outputs and can intervene before any action is taken: the system will proceed unless the reviewer intervenes. For example, a loan application processing system which will deliver reports of decisions to the loan officer but will submit the decision unless the loan officer intervenes. 
ROLE_OF_HUMANS_5: People will make decisions based on output provided by the system: the system will not proceed unless a person approves. For example, a loan application processing system that does not make the final loan approval decision without approval from the loan officer. 

For each intended use, Consider the following list of statements and identify the one that best describes the deployment environment complexity:
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_COMPLEXITY_1: Simple environment, such as when the deployment environment is static, possible input options are limited, and there are few unexpected situations that the system must deal with gracefully. For example, a natural language processing system used in a controlled research environment.
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_COMPLEXITY_2: Moderately complex environment, such as when the deployment environment varies, unexpected situations the system must deal with gracefully may occur, but when they do, there is little risk to people, and it is clear how to effectively mitigate issues. For example, a natural language processing system used in a corporate workplace where language is professional and communication norms change slowly.
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_COMPLEXITY_3: Complex environment, such as when the deployment environment is dynamic; the system will be deployed in an open and unpredictable environment or may be subject to drifts in input distributions over time. There are many possible types of inputs, and inputs may significantly vary in quality. Time and attention may be at a premium in making decisions and it can be difficult to mitigate issues. For example, a natural language processing system used on a social media platform where language and communication norms change rapidly.
